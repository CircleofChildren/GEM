A Youth-Led Project for Global Change

Global Empowerment Mandala (GEM) empowers youth to activate positive change in their community one peace project at a time. GEM offers youth the tools, resources, and guidance they require to take their creative solutions for peace and make them a reality. 

The primary tool GEM offers to create a global movement is a ‘state of the art’ social media platform that makes it easy and inspiring for the community to provide support for youth’s peace projects. We are inviting youth (ages 12-24), community mentors, schools, non-profit organizations and eco-conscious companies to join GEM’s philanthropic community network! Young people who join the network will receive an abundance of opportunities and resources to support them as they set out to create positive change in their local and global community.

Creation & Collaboration

We are designing a social media platform that will be clean, attractive, extremely user friendly and highly functional. Essentially, we want it to look beautiful and flow intuitively. We have most of the concept and design laid out, but we need a team of programmers and web designers to pull it all together.

By joining our team you will be helping to make the world a better place. You will be contributing to a paradigm-shifting project that empowers youth, builds community, creates an economy of gift-giving, and redesigns education through a project and service-based model that features open source access to information and do-it-yourself resources.
